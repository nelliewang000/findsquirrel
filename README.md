# Find Squirrel
This is the final project for the course Tools For Analytics.
We developed a website called "Squirrel Tracker" based on the data from the 2018 NYC census file. The data has 3023 squirrels records. 
Our website displays the following pages with functions:
1. squirrel/

    This is the home page of the website. There are 2 links redirecting to 2 main functional pages: map/ and sightings/.
    
2. squirrel/map

    In this page, geographical coordinations of each squirrel are marked on the OpenStreets map.
    
3. squirrel/sightings

    In this page, links are displayed to let users add or edit squirrel records, and see statistical graphs of 5 data attributions.
    
    - squirrel/sightings/add
    
        This is a page to add new squirrel records. Users must complete all required fields before "submit" in order to save the record.
    
    - squirrel/sightings/<unique_squirrel_id>
    
       This is a page to display records of each squirrel. Users can update the records and hit "submit" to save the updates, or hit "delete" to delete this record.
    
    - squirrel/sightings/stats
    
       This is a page to display statistical graphs of 5 data attributions.
